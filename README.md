# Classify-male-female-by-height-weight-shoesize

Hello, this is my first project on using sklearn to predict gender.
The data include 11 people with their heights, weights and shoe size.
There are 3 classifiers that I used for this project: Decision Tree, Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest.
I input my data (my height, weight and shoe size) and hoplefull that all three classifiers will predict that I am a male (which is my real gender)

Here is the result that I got:

DecisionTree:  ['male']

NearestNeighbors:  ['male']

RandomForest:  ['male']

I am glad that they all predicted the right result (insert big smile here).
